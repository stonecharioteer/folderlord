# folderlord
----

A python script to create an entire folder hierarchy, given a hierarchy textfile and the path (optional).

folderlord, with a lowercase f, is a tiny script I wrote for myself to create a project's folder hierarchy so I can add it to github effortlessly. All it needs for input is a folder-hierarchy diagram, stored in a text file that is passed to this.

#### Running folderlord

----

To run folderlord on Windows:

    ps: python folderlord.py instructions.text 'c:\path_to_folder\"

#### Dependencies:

Python 2.7 and a little common sense, perhaps.
